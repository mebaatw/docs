Elements
	- most common: p, table, span, a, and div
	- two forms: replaced (img, input) and nonreplaced.
	- display types: 
		- block-level: 
				- generates “breaks” before and after the element box 
				-  p and div ; List items 
		- inline-level: These elements do not generate a “break” before or after themselves, so they can appear within the content of another element without 
		                disrupting its display.
			- a element; strong and em
		- in HTML block-level elements cannot descend from inline-level elements
		- CSS, on the other hand, has no such restrictions. You can leave the markup as it is but change the display roles of the two elements like this:
			p {display: inline;}
			em {display: block;}
			this is not legal in HTML
		
Associate CSS with a document:
				- link tag
					- <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="sheet1.css" media="all">
					- link must be placed inside the head element but may not be placed inside any other element. 
					- only those link tags with a rel of stylesheet will be used in the initial display of the document
					- alternate stylesheets
				- @import declaration 
					- see above
					- Imports must be placed at the beginning of the stylesheet that contains them, but they are otherwise unconstrained.
					- @import can be highly useful if you have an external stylesheet that needs to use the styles found in other external stylesheets. 
					
Stylesheet Contents:
	- Rule Structure:
		h1 {color: red; background: yellow;}
		- Each rule has two fundamental parts: the selector (h1) and the declaration block (contained within --> {}). 
		- The declaration block is composed of one or more declarations ( separated by -> ;), 
		- Each declaration is a pairing of a property (color, background) and a value (red,yellow).
	- /* This is a CSS1 comment */	
		
Media Queries	
	- Media queries can be employed in the following places:
		- The media attribute of a link element
		- The media attribute of a style element
		- The media descriptor portion of an @import declaration
		- The media descriptor portion of an @media declaration	
	- types:
		- all: Use in all presentational media.
		- print: Use when printing the document for sighted users and also when displaying a print preview of the document.
		- screen: Use when presenting the document in a screen medium like a desktop computer monitor. 

Selectors
	- Elements of the document serve as the most basic selectors. 
		- In XML, a selector could be anything, since XML allows for the creation of new markup languages that can have just about anything as an element name
		- In an HTML document, on the other hand, the selector will generally be one of the many HTML elements such as p, h3, em, a, or even html itself.
		- For example:
			html {color: black;}
			h1 {color: gray;}
			h2 {color: silver;}
	- Grouping
		- Apply the same style to multiple elements
		- h2, p {color: gray;}
		- The comma tells the browser that there are two different selectors involved in the rule. Leaving out the comma would give the rule a different meaning
	- universal selector
		- *
		- wildcard matches any element
		- for example:  make every single element in a document red --> * {color: red;}
	- Grouping Declarations
		- h1 {font: 18px Helvetica; color: purple; background: aqua;}
	- New Elements in Old Browsers: --> document.createElement('main');	
	- Class Selectors
		- class selector reference is always preceded by a period (.)
		- .warning {font-weight: bold;}
		- <p class="warning">When handling plutonium, care must be taken to avoidthe formation of a critical mass.</p>
		- class selector can be combined:
			- p.warning {font-weight: bold;}
			- selector matches any p elements that have a class attribute containing the word warning
			- the warning paragraph is boldfaced
	- ID Selectors
